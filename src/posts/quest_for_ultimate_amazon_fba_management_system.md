#### How many pieces of software do you need to run an FBA business? 

I’ve been selling full time for over 3 years now and have come to depend on quite a few different tools.
Early on I realized that my competitors had some kind of pricing automation that would instantly undercut my prices.  I quickly realized that manually repricing products a few times a day was not how I wanted to spend the rest of my life, so I got a repricing tool.  Researching price lists from suppliers was exciting for the first few times, but that wore off quickly so I got a sourcing tool for that.  When I had lots of successful products it was feeling impossible to keep them in stock.  An inventory management tool was a big improvement.  This process continued - each problem had a solution that came with a monthly subscription fee.

As any FBA seller will tell you, the tools accumulate quickly.  They promise amazing and wonderful things and are easy to sign up for.  I started to notice that many of these tools were accessing the same Amazon reports and just doing different things with that data.  Not only was all of that data coming from the same place, but the functionality of each tool never seems to be quite right.  That is the nature of software design - you make a tool that is useful for as many people as possible but that means tradeoffs.  

> For each business that means you have to adapt your process to what the tool does.

![So many choices!](../images/child_in_front_of_vending_machine.jpg#display=table;width=385px;height=100%;margin-bottom=30px;margin-top=20px;margin-left=auto;margin-right=auto;foo=bar)

#### Possible Solution?
Of course the solution to all of this is custom software.  For a price you can have anything built that you want.  The perfect system that supports your business functions exactly the way you want.  This is a huge endeavor - not only very expensive but very susceptible to end poorly without the correct project definition, understanding of your processes, and project management skills.

I am not a huge company - just a guy working from home with a few VA’s and a lot of data to manage.  Always in the back of my mind has been the idea of being able to access my Amazon data directly and be able to use it to support some key functions.

The search continued for services that would be more flexible.  Found a few that were heading in the right direction but they were too limiting.  Some gave access to select reports but had their own functions for accessing select data.  Again I would have to find a way to fit my needed functionality into a limiting system.  For the sake of learning I bought a Fiverr gig that downloaded some Amazon reports through an Excel plugin.  Four revisions in I was getting data, but it was a slow, cumbersome, and buggy process.  Not what I wanted it to be.  So I abandoned that experiment and kept looking for a solution.

There are many amazing tools available to support FBA sellers.  I will always use some of them - they have teams of very talented people working hard and can accomplish great things.  That is part of the reason that we started [EcomDiscover](https://ecomdiscover.com/) - to catalog and sort through the increasingly overwhelming catalog of services available.  However what I am looking for is a way to support my core business functions in a way that is not currently possible with any tool that I am aware of.

#### The Future?
Recently I came in contact with an experienced development company interested in the ecommerce space and able to provide the framework I am looking for.  Basically they are looking for people to work with to develop their portfolio and better understand the needs of potential customers.  The company is [Hulft](https://ecomdiscover.com/reviews/hulft-online-services), and I do get a commission if people sign up with them for their services.

However my main purpose is to see what I can build with their services for my own use.  This blog series has a few different purposes - perhaps part of it is therapeutic as a way to vent my frustration at how things currently work.  Also I think this is a really interesting option for a lot of Amazon / ecommerce sellers and if I document what I am doing well it will save me from having to explain it over and over again.  Lastly (and probably most importantly) this will give some structure to what I want to create and will provide me with some extra motivation to continue making progress.

The next post will have more detail about my specific goals for the project.  If you have any comments or questions please let us know.
