Ok, so now I have [access to my Amazon data](../blog/quest_for_ultimate_amazon_fba_management_system_background_and_problem).  Now what?  It is kind of like buying a box of Lego and then having to decide what to build.  

Since you have to start somewhere, I sorted my main needs into two categories - Category One is sales data and Category Two is inventory data.  

1. **Sales Data:**  What is selling and what are the trends?  I have maybe 15 different suppliers.  It would be really useful to know what the sales and profit is for each supplier - which ones are increasing in sales?  Which ones are decreasing?  Which suppliers are the most profitable?  Which products have a high return rate?  Knowing that information really helps to decide where my time is best spent.
2. **Inventory Data:**  How much stock do I have?  How many days of inventory do I have for each item?  A list of my current products with this data would let me know the shape of the inventory.  From that information I should be able to decide what needs to be reordered and also items that have an excess of stock.  

These two types of information cover most of the essential data needed for running my business and will be very powerful tools.  

![Technically](../images/comic_technically.png#display=table;width=385px;height=100%;margin-bottom=30px;margin-top=20px;margin-left=auto;margin-right=auto;foo=bar)

In the next post I will go into more detail about what I want the Inventory Management function to cover.
