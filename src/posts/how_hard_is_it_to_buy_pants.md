This past summer, due to the heat and a global pandemic, I bought pants online. 

This may seem so uneventful as to be not worth mentioning. However, growing up as a Gen-Xer, my only experience with buying something that I hadn't already seen and touched was from the Sears catalogue, which is not very comparable. (Although the Barbie was great)

Why is buying online a challenge? Here are some subjective factors: 

1. **Category**: If it's something that has been seen somewhere else, already purchased once, a familiar brand, etc. it's fine. If it's not one of those things, it might not be fine. Especially if it's clothing.
2. **Quality/Appearance**: The number of times the purchased object has actually been the expected color can be counted on one hand. The number of times it has had the expected durability is slightly higher. 
3. **Returns**: Returning things is an ordeal, and the chances of returning things become higher when bought online. 

How did the pants work out?  
1. I had bought things from that website before and been satisfied. None of those things had been clothing. 
2. It was neither the shade or fit expected, even after struggling through the “choose your correct size” choices. I don't know which brand fits me best! If I did, I would be buying from them. 

A friend once went about a year only buying clothes online, and he never had to return anything once. Not once! Even shoes! When you stand in the store wondering, who is this size/shape/height for?, the answer is him. Which brings us to...
3. Yes, I had to return the pants. 

What, then, makes buying online attractive? 

* **Choice**: There are many more pants online than in any given store, but this can become a deterrent. Too many choices can make it harder to decide at all.
* **Price comparison**: Hey, the same pants are cheaper over here! 
* **Convenience**: Especially because global pandemic. 
* **Ease of return**: While I had to return the pants, the store had a very easy system wherein I did not have to speak to anyone at all or defend my return of the pants. This was huge! I might even buy clothes from them again. 

#### What sellers should know
There are probably a lot more people out there who have the technical ability to shop online but are reluctant to do so. This is what I, personally, want sellers to know.

Reviews are effective only if there are clear explanations. Honestly, star ratings seem to say more about the reviewer than the product. There should also be a distinction between ratings of products and ratings of customer service.

A well-curated selection is better than too many options that end up looking alike.

Including labels for return is a lovely, appreciated gesture. 


P.S. Still looking for pants.
