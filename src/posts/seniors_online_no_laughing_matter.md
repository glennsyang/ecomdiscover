It's fun to laugh about senior citizens using the Internet.
The idea of older people taking on technology seems like grist for stand-up comics.

However, consider the following 7 examples of older people accomplishing great things:
* Anna Mary Robertson Moses (better known as Grandma Moses) didn't begin to paint until the age of 76. One of her paintings sold for 1.2 million US, in 2006.
* Colonel Saunders was 65 when Kentucky Fried Chicken was born. 
* At the age of 77,  John Glenn rode the space shuttle Discovery.
* At the age of 52, Ray Kroc set out to build the McDonald's brand and continued to be involved in operations until his death at 82. 
* Peter Roget first published his Thesaurus at age 73 and oversaw all editions until he died at 90.
* Laura Ingalls Wilder's books became the NBC hit series “Little House On The Prairie”. Wilder published her first book when she was 64.
* Harry Bernstein, another novelist (The Invisible Wall, published 2006, when he was 96) stated: “My 90's were the most productive years of my life.”

#### What are the facts?
So we might want to re-think. Are we too quick to categorize the older generation? In fact, do statistics show that seniors, in general, are adapting? Are they going online for their needs?
* 92% of seniors have window shopped online
* 78% have made purchases
* 71% of them go online daily
* Seniors spend 6 more days per month on the Internet and view 178 more pages compared to 18-24 year olds

According to the Pew Research Center, all of these numbers will soon be dwarfed by the *“silver tsunami.”* Those easing into the senior bracket are making 'wired seniors' the ***fastest-growing*** demographic group online. 

At the moment, there are about 52 million people (in the US) 65 or older. That *'mature market'* has over ***$1.6 trillion*** in spending power. This demographic is projected to almost double by 2060, to 95 million people.

<p style="text-align: center;">It's time to rethink attitudes toward seniors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The coming "silver tsunami" cannot be ignored.</p>

#### Aging Misconceptions

In 2009, the term “Stereotype Embodiment Theory” was introduced. In short it means:  how you think about getting older can affect how you age. Professor Becca Levy explained, 
> “We found the risk of dementia goes up with people who have taken in more negative age stereotypes, but you can also think that people who take in more positive age stereotypes have a cognitive advantage.” 

An example of this comes from the University of Dallas. Dr. Denise Park chose 221 adults, 60 to 90 years of age. Some were assigned to learn a new skill which required active engagement, long-term memory and other high-level cognitive processes. The others were instructed to engage in more familiar activities at home, like listening to music, or doing crossword puzzles. After 3 months, it was convincingly noticeable that the group assigned to learn new skills showed improvement in mental prowess. It proves the old adage: Use it or lose it.
Or, as John Quincy Adams put it, 

> “Old minds are like old horses; you must exercise them if you wish to keep them in working order.”

#### Seniors Online is Serious Business
So, the stand-up comics have made us laugh but they have also contributed to furthering a misleading stereotype. Contrary to current perceptions, Mintel Market Research affirms seniors are not only more tech-savvy than they’re given credit for, they’re also hungry for information. Marketers need to step up and communicate with seniors, as it has frequently been an overlooked demographic.

One drawback for seniors is affordability. Internet costs can easily exceed $50 to $100 a month. For
seniors on a fixed income, or low income, this cost is prohibitive. But that's a subject for another time.
