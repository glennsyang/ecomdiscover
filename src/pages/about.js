                    Angie's List members submit more than 60,000 reviews every month about the companies they hire. They include incredible details about how the project went (including cost), and grade the company's response time, price, professionalism and quality of work -- good or bad -- on an A to F scale. Angie's List members will tell you if a crew was conscious of children and pets, cleaned up after themselves or just totally botched the job.

                    Through Angie's List, you have the ability to quickly and easily tell thousands of other Angie's List members about your experiences with a company. That's really great news for the companies that do quality work - and not so great news for the companies that don't. So when contractors know that you're an Angie's List member, we've found that you're more likely to get a quick call back, the crews show up on time and work is completed faster.
